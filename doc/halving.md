At the beginning of Bitcoin project 50 COINs were rewarded for every block found on the network.

Reward (subsidy) is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.

The maximum coin supply is limited by the number of halvings. At some point in time the reward will reach 0.
